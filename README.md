# M3C2 : Neural Networks

Project 2: ‘Neural Networks’ completed for ‘High Performance Computing’ module.

This project involves training a neural network to classify hand written digits using the MNIST dataset. The code implements a single neuron model (SNM) and a neural network model (NNM). The key subroutines are written in Fortran in the files `hw2_dev.f90` and `hw2_main.f90` to enhance speed performance and are imported as modules into Python to use. The function `nm_analyze` in the file `hw2_dev.py` code is split into three sections each generating a figure that is used to explore and illustrate the key qualitative trends in the performance of the single neuron and neural network model. The doctoring of this function contains an analysis of each plot along with conclusions. All code was written in Python and Fortran 90. 

Below is a description of the figures generated by the code:

- hw21.png - This figure is a plot comparing the test error of the single neuron model (SNM) and the neural network model (NNM) as the number of training images (d) are increased. 
- hw22.png - This figure is a plot comparing the run time of the single neuron model (SNM) and the neural network model (NNM) as the number of training images (d) are increased.
- hw23.png - This figure is a plot of the test errors as the number of neurons are increased in the neural network model (NNM).
